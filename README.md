# Jyputer notebook for generating coord. sets with constrain.
The jupyter notebook for finding the possible arrangement of the lowest electrostatic energy of molecules. __Need "MPC2_phy_proj.py" for running__

## Make sure "MPC2_phy_proj.py" and "my_template_calculate_total_electrostatic_energy_with_contrain01.func" in the same dictionary

## Read the annnotated for important infor.
